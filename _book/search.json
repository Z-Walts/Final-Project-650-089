As a result, we used a Spearman rank correlation to test each hypothesis. In Table 2.1 we see that both p-values are well below our pre-established cutoff of 0.05. Since we are doing multiple statistical tests, we could adjust the p-values to account for this. However, since there are only two tests and the p-values are several orders of magnitude smaller than our cutoff, this is unnecessary. Both duration and intensity were negatively correlated with popularity to a weak degree; neither coefficient was on the expected scale. Since intensity was a composite measure, exploration of how the components relate to popularity could explain why the direction of correlation was unexpected.\n\n\nTable 2.1: Spearman Rank Correlation Results\n\n\nFactor\np-value\nCoefficient\n\n\n\n\nDuration\n1.4736263^{-81}\n-0.1132319\n\n\nIntensity\n4.6505396^{-66}\n-0.1016895"
